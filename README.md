# Fragments of meaning

Fragments of meaning (Frammenti di senso) is a sound artwork exploring ruminative thinking and thought disorders through an immersive auditory experience. Using algorithmic processes and mechanical elements, it reflects the obsessive, fragmented nature of disordered thoughts.

This web version simulates the physical installation by presenting three interactive elements, each representing a 'machine-brain' that alternates between emitting sound and becoming obscured, reflecting the dynamics of ruminative thought and self-perception.
